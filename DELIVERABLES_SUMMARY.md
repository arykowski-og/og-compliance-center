## 💡 Key Insights

### Market Opportunity
The compliance guidance space for local governments is a **blue ocean opportunity**—no direct competitors exist despite a large addressable market (50,000+ potential customers) and clear, validated user pain points.

### User Needs
All four user personas share common pain points: complex legal language, fragmented information sources, difficulty tracking changes, and limited resources/expertise. A platform addressing these needs has strong product-market fit potential.

### Design Strategy
Supporting three navigation paths (state-centric, topic-centric, search-driven) accommodates different user mental models and increases likelihood of users finding information quickly.

### Financial Potential
Conservative Year 1 projection of $1.2M-2.5M ARR with 300-500 customers grows to $12M-20M by Year 3 with 2,000-3,000 customers—a 5-8x growth trajectory with strong unit economics.

### Competitive Advantage
First-mover advantage, combined with OpenGov's existing relationships, government expertise, and integrated platform, creates defensible competitive moat via network effects and switching costs.
