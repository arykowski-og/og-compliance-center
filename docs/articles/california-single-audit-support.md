# California: Single Audit Support (A-133/Uniform Guidance)

## What You Need to Know

If your California local government receives federal grant money, you need to track how you spend it. When you spend more than $750,000 in federal funds in a year, federal law requires you to get a special type of audit called a Single Audit. This audit checks that you're using federal money correctly and following all the rules. California also has its own reporting requirements on top of the federal ones.

## Key Requirements

- **Track all federal grants separately** from your other money so you can report on each program
- **Add up your total federal spending** each year to see if you've crossed the $750,000 threshold
- **Hire a qualified auditor** who has experience with Single Audits and federal compliance
- **Create a Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards (SEFA)** that lists every federal program and how much you spent
- **Test your internal controls** for each major federal program to show you have proper safeguards
- **Submit your audit report** to the Federal Audit Clearinghouse within 9 months of your fiscal year end
- **File reports with California's State Controller's Office** as required for state oversight
- **Fix any findings** from the audit and create corrective action plans for problems

## Who Does This Apply To?

The Single Audit requirement applies to all California local governments that receive federal awards. This includes counties, cities, towns, special districts, school districts, and other government entities. If you receive federal money through grants, contracts, loans, or other assistance programs, you need to track your spending carefully.

The key number to remember is $750,000. If your entity spends this amount or more in federal awards during your fiscal year, you must have a Single Audit performed. This threshold applies to your total federal expenditures across all programs combined—not per program. Even if you receive small grants from multiple federal agencies, they all count toward this threshold.

California has additional requirements beyond the federal rules. Your Single Audit must meet both federal standards under the Uniform Guidance (2 CFR Part 200) and California Government Code requirements. The State Controller's Office may require specific reporting formats or additional schedules. You'll also need to make your audit publicly available and may need to submit it to state agencies that pass through federal funds to you.

## Step-by-Step Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Set Up Federal Grant Tracking Systems

Before you spend any federal money, you need a system to track it properly. Your accounting system should identify each federal award with its unique CFDA number (Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance, now called Assistance Listings). Create separate accounts or cost centers for each federal program so you can easily report on them individually.

Your tracking system needs to capture more than just expenses. Record the federal agency providing the funds, the program name, award number, award period, and any pass-through entities. If California's State Controller or another state agency passes federal money to you, document that relationship. Keep all grant agreements, amendments, and correspondence organized and accessible.

Set up your chart of accounts to distinguish federal funds from state, local, and other revenue sources. This separation makes it much easier when audit time comes. Train your staff on proper coding procedures so federal transactions don't accidentally get mixed with other funds. Document your procedures in writing so there's consistency even when staff changes.

**Timing:** Complete this setup before you receive your first federal payment.

**Responsible Party:** Finance Director, Accounting Manager, Grants Manager

**Important:** Don't wait until audit time to organize your federal spending. Proper tracking from day one prevents major headaches later and reduces audit costs.

### Step 2: Monitor Your Spending Throughout the Year

Check your federal expenditure totals quarterly to see if you're approaching the $750,000 threshold. Many organizations are surprised to learn they've crossed this line and need a Single Audit. Regular monitoring gives you time to prepare if you're getting close.

Create a simple spreadsheet or report that lists each federal program and the amount spent to date. Include all forms of federal assistance: grants, cooperative agreements, cost-reimbursement contracts, loans, loan guarantees, interest subsidies, and non-cash assistance like donated property or commodities. Some organizations forget to count non-cash items, but they do count toward your threshold.

If you're trending toward the $750,000 mark, notify your governing board and start planning for the audit. You'll need to budget for audit costs (typically $15,000-$50,000 depending on your size and complexity) and allocate staff time to support the audit process. Early planning prevents last-minute scrambling.

**Timing:** Review federal spending quarterly; conduct a formal threshold check by the 9-month mark of your fiscal year.

**Responsible Party:** Finance Director, Chief Financial Officer

**Tip:** Some federal programs have specific compliance requirements even below the $750,000 threshold. Track your spending anyway to ensure you're meeting program-specific rules.

### Step 3: Hire a Qualified Single Audit Firm

Single Audits are specialized. Not every CPA firm has the expertise to perform them properly. Start your search for an auditor at least 6 months before your fiscal year ends. Look for firms with government audit experience and specific Single Audit expertise.

Your auditor must follow Government Auditing Standards (also called the "Yellow Book") and have peer reviews that confirm their quality. Ask potential firms about their government audit practice, how many Single Audits they perform annually, and their familiarity with California requirements. Request references from other California local governments.

Review your auditor engagement letter carefully. It should specify that the audit will comply with Government Auditing Standards, the Uniform Guidance, and California state requirements. Confirm the deliverables include the Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards (SEFA), the Data Collection Form for submission to the Federal Audit Clearinghouse, and any reports required by California's State Controller.

**Timing:** Begin the selection process 6-9 months before fiscal year end; engage the auditor by fiscal year end.

**Responsible Party:** Finance Director, City/County Manager, Board/Council

**Warning:** Some auditors without Single Audit experience may accept the engagement but struggle with compliance requirements. Always verify their qualifications and experience.

### Step 4: Prepare Your Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards (SEFA)

The SEFA is the foundation of your Single Audit. This schedule lists every federal program you participated in during the year, showing the federal agency, program name, Assistance Listings number (formerly CFDA number), pass-through entity if applicable, and the amount expended. Your auditor uses this document to determine which programs to test.

Start preparing your SEFA draft at fiscal year end. Gather information from your accounting system for each federal award. Include the award identification number and indicate whether the program had amounts passed through to subrecipients. For loans and loan programs, report the outstanding balance at year end in addition to current year activity.

Review your SEFA carefully for completeness and accuracy. A common mistake is forgetting to include all federal assistance. Check for programs that continued from prior years, programs that ended mid-year, and programs that started late in the year. Include non-cash assistance like food commodities or donated equipment at their fair market value.

**Timing:** Draft the SEFA within 30 days of fiscal year end; finalize during the audit.

**Responsible Party:** Grants Manager, Accounting Manager, Finance Director

**Critical:** Your SEFA must reconcile to your financial statements. Any differences need to be explained. Auditors will verify this reconciliation.

### Step 5: Support the Audit Process

Once your auditor begins fieldwork, they'll need substantial documentation and staff time. They'll test your internal controls, examine transactions, and verify compliance with federal requirements. Be prepared to provide grant agreements, policies and procedures, payroll records, procurement documentation, and other evidence.

Your auditor will select "major programs" for detailed testing based on risk and dollar amounts. For each major program, they'll test compliance with specific requirements from the OMB Compliance Supplement. These typically include allowable costs, cash management, eligibility, matching requirements, and reporting. Have staff familiar with each program available to answer questions.

Respond promptly to audit requests and information document requests. The faster you provide information, the more efficiently the audit proceeds, which can reduce costs. If auditors identify concerns, address them immediately rather than waiting for the final report. Proactive fixes demonstrate good management.

**Timing:** Auditor fieldwork typically occurs 2-4 months after fiscal year end and lasts 2-6 weeks.

**Responsible Party:** Finance staff, program managers, department heads

**Tip:** Assign a single point of contact to coordinate audit requests and communication. This prevents confusion and keeps the audit moving smoothly.

### Step 6: Submit Reports and Implement Corrective Actions

After the audit is complete, you'll receive several reports: your financial statements, the auditor's opinion on the financial statements, the auditor's opinion on internal controls and compliance, the SEFA, and a schedule of findings and questioned costs (if any). You must submit the complete reporting package to the Federal Audit Clearinghouse within 30 days of receiving the reports or 9 months after fiscal year end, whichever is earlier.

Submit your Data Collection Form and reporting package electronically through the Federal Audit Clearinghouse website. California's State Controller's Office may require you to submit copies as well. Check with any state agencies that pass through federal funds to you—they often want copies of your audit report.

If your audit includes findings, develop a corrective action plan that addresses each one. Explain what went wrong, what you're doing to fix it, who's responsible, and your timeline for completion. Monitor implementation of your corrective actions and document your progress. Federal agencies take repeat findings seriously, which can jeopardize future funding.

**Timing:** Submit reports within 30 days of receipt or 9 months after fiscal year end, whichever is earlier.

**Responsible Party:** Finance Director, City/County Manager

**Important:** Late submission or failure to submit your audit can result in sanctions, including suspension of federal funding. Mark your deadlines clearly and work backward to ensure timely completion.

## Official Sources

**California Government Code Section 8546.7** establishes California's requirements for Single Audits of local governments that receive federal financial assistance. This code section incorporates federal Single Audit requirements and authorizes the State Controller to establish additional reporting requirements for California entities.

**2 CFR Part 200 (Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards)** is the federal regulation that governs Single Audits. Subpart F of this regulation, often called the "Uniform Guidance," replaced the old OMB Circular A-133 and sets the $750,000 threshold, audit requirements, and compliance standards.

**OMB Compliance Supplement** is published annually by the federal Office of Management and Budget. This detailed document specifies what auditors must test for each federal program, including compliance requirements and suggested audit procedures. Your auditor relies heavily on this supplement to conduct your audit.

## Common Questions

**Q: We usually spend around $700,000 in federal funds per year. Do we need a Single Audit?**

A: Not if you stay below $750,000, but you're close enough that you should monitor carefully. If you receive an unexpected draw-down, a new grant, or a reimbursement that pushes you over the threshold, you'll need the audit. Some organizations strategically manage their spending to stay below the threshold, but this isn't always practical or advisable. Remember that all federal assistance counts—grants, loans, non-cash items, everything. Consider having your auditor perform a threshold calculation to be certain.

**Q: Our fiscal year ended 8 months ago and we just realized we need a Single Audit. What should we do?**

A: Act immediately. You have 9 months from fiscal year end to submit your audit to the Federal Audit Clearinghouse. Contact qualified Single Audit firms right away and explain the urgent timeline. You may face higher fees due to the rush, but late submission carries serious penalties including potential suspension of federal funding. While working on the current year, also evaluate your monitoring systems to prevent this situation from happening again.

**Q: Can we use our regular financial audit firm, or do we need a specialist?**

A: Your regular firm can perform your Single Audit if they have the proper qualifications, but many small firms don't specialize in this area. The auditor must have experience with Government Auditing Standards (Yellow Book) and the Uniform Guidance. They should have a current peer review showing their government audit practice meets quality standards. It's perfectly fine to ask your current auditor about their Single Audit experience. If they're not qualified, they should recommend a firm that is.

**Q: What happens if the auditor finds problems with how we spent federal money?**

A: Audit findings fall into different categories. Some are about internal control weaknesses that need fixing. Others involve non-compliance with federal requirements, which may include "questioned costs"—expenditures the auditor questions as allowable. You'll need to respond to each finding with a corrective action plan. Federal agencies review your findings and may require repayment of questioned costs. Serious or repeated findings can lead to additional monitoring, special conditions on grants, or even suspension of funding.

**Q: Does California require anything beyond the federal Single Audit requirements?**

A: Yes. California Government Code Section 8546.7 requires compliance with federal Single Audit rules and authorizes the State Controller's Office to establish additional requirements. You may need to submit your audit report to the State Controller in a specific format or timeframe. California also expects you to make your audit publicly available. Check with the State Controller's Office and any California agencies that provide you with federal pass-through funds for their specific requirements.

## Enforcement & Penalties

The federal government enforces Single Audit requirements through multiple channels. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) sets the overall standards. Individual federal agencies (like the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Department of Transportation, or Department of Justice) enforce compliance for their specific programs. The federal Audit Follow-Up System tracks whether you've submitted your audit on time and whether you've addressed findings.

Failure to complete a Single Audit when required is a serious compliance violation. Federal agencies can impose special conditions on your grants, withhold payments, suspend or terminate federal awards, or permanently bar you from receiving future federal funding. These aren't theoretical penalties—federal agencies do enforce them when entities fail to submit audits or repeatedly fail to address findings.

At the state level, California's State Controller's Office monitors compliance with state requirements. The Controller can require additional reporting or audits if you fail to meet state standards. State agencies that pass through federal funds to you may also impose sanctions. If you receive federal Community Development Block Grant funds through the state, for example, the state housing authority will want to see your audit and verify you're addressing any findings.

The financial risks are substantial. If auditors question costs and federal agencies require repayment, you must return that money—often with interest. This can create serious budget problems, especially for smaller entities. Beyond financial penalties, the reputational damage can affect your ability to apply for competitive grants. Grant reviewers can see your audit history and may view poor audit results as a red flag about your management capacity.
