# California: GASB 54 Fund Balance Reporting

## What You Need to Know

GASB 54 is an accounting standard that tells local governments how to classify and report their fund balances in financial statements. It creates five clear categories that show how freely your agency can spend different portions of its funds. All California local governments that prepare financial statements following Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) must follow these rules to show taxpayers and oversight agencies where your money is and how you can use it.

## Key Requirements

**Fund Balance Classification**
You must classify all governmental fund balances into one of five categories: nonspendable, restricted, committed, assigned, or unassigned. Each category shows different levels of constraint on how you can spend the money.

**Written Fund Balance Policy**
Your governing body must establish a formal written policy that defines how you'll classify committed and assigned fund balances. This policy must specify who has authority to make these classifications.

**Spending Order Policy**
You need a policy that establishes the order in which you'll spend different fund balance categories when you have multiple options. Most governments spend restricted funds first, then committed, then assigned, then unassigned.

**Modified Accrual Accounting**
You must use modified accrual accounting for all governmental funds. This means you record revenues when they become measurable and available, and expenditures when liabilities are incurred.

**Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR)**
You must prepare a CAFR that includes the required fund balance disclosures. Your notes to the financial statements must explain significant policies and the amounts in each classification.

**Formal Actions for Commitments**
To classify fund balance as "committed," your governing body (city council, board of supervisors, etc.) must take formal action through ordinance or resolution. This creates the highest level of internal constraint.

**Stabilization Arrangements**
If you set aside funds for emergencies or economic uncertainties, you must properly classify them based on whether they meet specific criteria outlined in GASB 54.

**Annual Review and Updates**
You should review your fund balance classifications annually and update them based on changes in constraints, policies, or circumstances.

## Who Does This Apply To?

GASB 54 applies to all California local governments that prepare GAAP-based financial statements, including:

- **Counties:** All 58 California counties
- **Cities:** All incorporated cities regardless of size
- **Special Districts:** School districts, water districts, fire districts, and other special-purpose agencies
- **Joint Powers Authorities (JPAs):** Multi-agency partnerships that prepare GAAP financial statements

If your agency prepares financial statements that will be audited by independent auditors or submitted to bond rating agencies, you must comply with GASB 54. The California State Controller's Office oversees compliance for cities and counties through its annual financial reporting requirements.

Even small agencies with limited staff must follow these standards. However, if your agency uses a cash basis or modified cash basis of accounting (not GAAP), GASB 54 may not fully apply.

## Step-by-Step Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Review Your Current Fund Structure
**What to do:** Start by listing all your governmental funds (General Fund, special revenue funds, debt service funds, capital projects funds, and permanent funds). Create a spreadsheet showing each fund's current balance and any restrictions or limitations on how you can use the money.

**Timing:** Begin 4-6 months before your fiscal year-end

**Responsible party:** Finance Director with assistance from accounting staff

**Practical tips:** Meet with department heads to understand any informal designations or planned uses of funds. Review prior year audit reports to identify previously reported restrictions. Don't forget smaller funds that may have been set up years ago—they still need proper classification.

### Step 2: Identify and Classify Nonspendable Balances
**What to do:** Identify amounts that cannot be spent because they're not in spendable form (like inventory, prepaid expenses, or land held for resale) or because they must remain intact legally or contractually (like permanent fund principal).

**Timing:** 3-4 months before fiscal year-end

**Responsible party:** Accounting staff with review by Finance Director

**Practical tips:** Review your balance sheet accounts systematically. Common nonspendable items include store inventories, prepaid insurance, and long-term loans receivable. Remember that permanent fund principal is always nonspendable, but the earnings can be spent and should be classified separately.

### Step 3: Determine Restricted Fund Balances
**What to do:** Identify amounts that are restricted by external parties such as grantors, bond covenants, state or federal laws, or constitutional provisions. Review all grant agreements, debt covenants, and enabling legislation.

**Timing:** 2-3 months before fiscal year-end

**Responsible party:** Finance Director, Grant Manager, and City/County Attorney

**Practical tips:** Document the source of each restriction. Gas tax revenues are restricted by state law. Grant funds are restricted by grant agreements. Bond proceeds are restricted by debt covenants. If you're unsure whether something is truly "restricted," ask your auditor.

### Step 4: Establish Committed and Assigned Classifications
**What to do:** Work with your governing body to adopt a formal fund balance policy. This resolution or ordinance should specify who can commit funds (usually only the governing body) and who can assign funds (often the finance director or city manager). Then classify your remaining balances.

**Timing:** 1-2 months before fiscal year-end

**Responsible party:** Finance Director proposes policy; governing body adopts it

**Practical tips:** Committed balances require formal action like a resolution or ordinance. Assigned balances can be done through less formal means as specified in your policy. Make sure your policy is clear about the level of action required for each category. Many governments commit funds for specific capital projects or multi-year initiatives.

### Step 5: Calculate Unassigned Fund Balance
**What to do:** After classifying all other fund balances, the remaining amount in your General Fund is unassigned. This is the most flexible money you have. Other governmental funds (like special revenue funds) generally cannot have positive unassigned balances—only the General Fund can.

**Timing:** 1 month before fiscal year-end

**Responsible party:** Accounting staff

**Practical tips:** Your unassigned fund balance is what most people think of as your "savings account." Many governments aim to maintain a specific minimum level, like 15% of annual expenditures. Consider establishing a formal policy on minimum unassigned fund balance levels.

### Step 6: Update Financial Statements and Train Staff
**What to do:** Update your CAFR templates to show the five-category classification on the balance sheet and in the notes to financial statements. Train your accounting staff on the new classifications and your new policies. Document everything for your auditors.

**Timing:** Before fiscal year-end close

**Responsible party:** Finance Director and entire accounting team

**Practical tips:** Create a checklist that your staff can use each year to classify fund balances consistently. Keep a file with all documentation supporting restricted, committed, and assigned classifications. Meet with your auditors early in the process to confirm your approach. Consider creating a one-page reference guide for staff showing examples of each classification category.

## Understanding the Five Classifications

### Nonspendable Fund Balance

**Definition:** Amounts that cannot be spent because they are not in spendable form or must remain intact legally or contractually.

**When to use this classification:** Use this category for assets that you own but cannot convert to cash and spend, or for funds that must legally remain as principal.

**Practical examples:**
- **Inventory and supplies:** Your public works department's stockpile of road materials
- **Prepaid expenses:** Insurance premiums you've paid in advance for next year
- **Long-term loans receivable:** Money you've loaned to a developer that won't be repaid for several years
- **Permanent fund principal:** An endowment where the original gift must stay intact, though you can spend the earnings
- **Land held for resale:** Property your redevelopment agency acquired but hasn't sold yet

### Restricted Fund Balance

**Definition:** Amounts that can only be used for specific purposes because external parties or laws have imposed constraints.

**When to use this classification:** Use this category when someone or something outside your government has legally limited how you can spend the money.

**Practical examples:**
- **Gas tax revenues:** State law requires you to spend these funds only on street and road maintenance
- **Grant funds:** Federal or state grant agreements specify exactly how you can use the money
- **Bond proceeds:** Debt covenants require you to use bond proceeds for the approved capital project
- **Development impact fees:** State law restricts these fees to specific infrastructure improvements
- **Redevelopment funds:** California law (prior to dissolution) restricted how these funds could be spent
- **Public safety grants:** Federal COPS grants that must be used for police personnel and equipment

### Committed Fund Balance

**Definition:** Amounts that can only be used for specific purposes because your governing body has imposed constraints through formal action.

**When to use this classification:** Use this category when your city council, board of supervisors, or board of directors has passed a resolution or ordinance dedicating funds to a specific purpose. This is your highest level of self-imposed constraint.

**Practical examples:**
- **Capital project reserves:** Council resolution dedicating $5 million to a future civic center project
- **Technology replacement fund:** Board action committing funds to replace IT infrastructure on a planned schedule
- **Pension stabilization:** Formal commitment to set aside funds to address unfunded pension liabilities
- **Economic development initiatives:** Council-approved commitment to fund business attraction programs
- **Equipment replacement:** Formal commitment to fund future replacement of fire engines and police vehicles

**Important distinction:** To remove or change a commitment, your governing body must take the same type of formal action they used to create it. This makes committed balances relatively inflexible.

### Assigned Fund Balance

**Definition:** Amounts that you intend to use for specific purposes, but the constraint is less formal than a commitment.

**When to use this classification:** Use this category when someone in your organization (as specified in your fund balance policy) has designated funds for a particular use, but without formal governing body action.

**Practical examples:**
- **Planned purchases:** Your finance director assigns funds to purchase new financial software next year
- **Budget carry-forwards:** Department balances you allow to roll over for ongoing projects
- **Encumbrances:** Purchase orders issued but not yet received or paid
- **Multi-year projects:** Funds set aside for projects that span multiple budget years
- **Self-insurance reserves:** Funds designated for potential liability claims
- **Planned transfers:** Money you plan to transfer to other funds for specific purposes

**Important distinction:** Your fund balance policy should specify who has authority to assign fund balance. This is typically the finance director, city manager, or budget officer—not the full governing body. Assignments can be changed more easily than commitments.

### Unassigned Fund Balance

**Definition:** The remaining fund balance in your General Fund that has no constraints or specific intended uses. This is your most flexible money.

**When to use this classification:** Use this category for all General Fund balance not classified in the other four categories. For other governmental funds (like special revenue funds), you typically only report negative unassigned fund balance.

**Practical examples:**
- **General Fund reserves:** Your "savings account" available for any lawful purpose
- **Budget stabilization:** Undesignated reserves to address revenue shortfalls or unexpected expenses
- **Operating cushion:** Funds that provide cash flow during the fiscal year
- **Opportunity funds:** Flexible money for unexpected needs or opportunities
- **Negative balances in other funds:** Special revenue funds with deficits show negative unassigned fund balance

**Important distinction:** Only the General Fund can have positive unassigned fund balance. If a special revenue fund or other governmental fund has a positive balance that doesn't fit the other categories, you should examine whether that fund should continue to exist or be merged into your General Fund.

## Common Questions

**What's the difference between "committed" and "assigned" fund balance? They both seem like internal designations.**

The key difference is the level of formal authority and how difficult it is to change the classification. Committed fund balance requires your governing body (city council, board of supervisors) to take formal action through a resolution or ordinance. This creates the highest level of self-imposed constraint. To later remove or change a commitment, the governing body must take the same type of formal action. Assigned fund balance is less formal—your fund balance policy can authorize the city manager, finance director, or another official to assign funds without full governing body action. Assignments are easier to change and remove. Think of commitments as "locked in by the board" and assignments as "designated by management."

**Does California require a minimum fund balance level? What should our target be?**

California law does not mandate a specific minimum fund balance level for most local governments. However, the Government Finance Officers Association (GFOA) recommends maintaining unrestricted fund balance (committed, assigned, and unassigned combined) of at least two months of regular General Fund operating revenues or expenditures—roughly 17% of your annual budget. Many California governments set their own policies requiring minimum unassigned fund balance levels ranging from 10% to 25% of expenditures. Your ideal level depends on factors like revenue volatility, economic conditions, reserve needs, and risk tolerance. Bond rating agencies look favorably on governments with strong fund balance levels. Consider adopting a formal fund balance policy that establishes your target minimum and explains how you'll restore fund balance if it falls below the minimum.

**How do we establish a fund balance policy? What should it include?**

Your governing body should adopt a formal fund balance policy through resolution or ordinance. The policy should include: (1) definitions of each fund balance category, (2) minimum fund balance targets for your General Fund, (3) identification of who has authority to commit fund balance (typically the governing body), (4) identification of who has authority to assign fund balance (typically finance director or city manager), (5) the order in which different fund balance categories will be spent, and (6) procedures for restoring fund balance if it falls below minimum levels. Many California governments also include policies on stabilization arrangements for emergencies. The California Society of Municipal Finance Officers (CSMFO) provides sample policies you can adapt to your agency's needs. Have your city attorney or county counsel review the policy before adoption.

**Where do fund balances appear in our CAFR? What disclosures are required?**

Fund balance classifications appear in two main places in your CAFR. First, they're shown on the balance sheet (or statement of net position) for governmental funds, with separate lines for each of the five categories. Second, the notes to financial statements must include detailed disclosures explaining your fund balance policies, the purposes for restrictions, commitments and assignments, and the amounts in each category for each major fund and in aggregate for non-major funds. If you maintain stabilization arrangements, you must disclose the authority for creating them, requirements for additions, conditions for spending, and current balance. Your auditors will review these disclosures carefully to ensure they comply with GASB 54 requirements.

**How should we handle stabilization arrangements or "rainy day funds" under GASB 54?**

Stabilization arrangements are amounts set aside for emergencies or economic uncertainties. GASB 54 has specific criteria that determine how to classify these funds. To be classified as committed or restricted, a stabilization arrangement must meet three conditions: (1) it must be formally authorized through ordinance, resolution, or policy, (2) circumstances for use must be identified (like revenue shortfalls or declared emergencies), and (3) it must be specific enough that you can measure whether conditions for use have been met. If your stabilization arrangement meets these criteria and was established by governing body action, classify it as committed. If established by external law or requirement, classify it as restricted. If your "rainy day fund" is just a general intention without formal criteria, it should be classified as unassigned (if in the General Fund) or assigned at most. Many California cities have strengthened their stabilization policies after GASB 54 to ensure proper classification and demonstrate fiscal prudence to rating agencies.

## Enforcement & Penalties

**State Controller Oversight**

The California State Controller's Office oversees financial reporting for cities and counties. All cities must file an Annual Report of Financial Transactions (often called the "State Controller's Report"), and counties must file similar reports. These reports require you to present fund information consistent with GASB 54 classifications. The State Controller reviews these reports for compliance and may request corrections or additional information.

**Independent Audit Requirements**

Most California local governments are required to obtain annual independent audits. Auditors will examine your fund balance classifications as part of their audit procedures. If you misclassify fund balances or lack proper documentation, auditors may issue findings or qualifications in their audit report. Material misstatements could result in a qualified or adverse audit opinion.

**Bond Rating Agency Impact**

While not enforcement in the legal sense, bond rating agencies (Moody's, S&P, Fitch) rely heavily on GASB 54 fund balance classifications when rating your debt. They particularly focus on unrestricted fund balance levels (committed, assigned, and unassigned). Misclassification could lead to lower credit ratings, which increases your borrowing costs. Rating agencies want to see conservative policies and strong unassigned fund balance levels.

**Potential Consequences of Non-Compliance**

Non-compliance with GASB 54 typically does not result in direct fines or penalties under California law. However, consequences can include:

- **Qualified audit opinion:** Makes it difficult to issue debt or receive grants
- **Loss of credibility:** Damages relationships with oversight agencies, rating agencies, and the public
- **Increased scrutiny:** State Controller or auditors may require more frequent reporting or monitoring
- **Grant eligibility issues:** Some federal and state grants require GAAP-compliant financial statements
- **Legal challenges:** Misrepresentation of financial position could lead to legal issues if you issue debt or make representations to investors
- **Career impact:** Finance directors at non-compliant agencies risk professional reputation damage

**Best Practices to Ensure Compliance**

Work closely with your independent auditors throughout the year, not just during audit season. Adopt clear written policies and document your decision-making process for classifications. Provide annual training to staff on GASB 54 requirements. Stay current with State Controller guidance and CSMFO resources. When in doubt, consult with your auditors or professional advisors before finalizing classifications.
