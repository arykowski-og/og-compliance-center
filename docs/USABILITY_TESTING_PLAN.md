   - Mention observation for research only, not performance evaluation
   - Can pause if stuck (but let them try first)

2. **Give Task Scenario**
   - Read scenario aloud
   - Give printed copy or display on separate screen
   - Confirm participant understands goal
   - Say "go ahead and start" - don't help with first steps

3. **During Task**
   - Listen to think-aloud comments
   - Note when user struggles, pauses, expresses confusion
   - Note any workarounds or unexpected behaviors
   - Note positive moments ("oh, that's nice!")
   - Take screenshots of key moments
   - Don't interrupt unless user is completely blocked (>2 min pause)
   - Ask follow-up questions sparingly ("why did you click that?")

4. **After Each Task**
   - Ask: "On a scale of 1-10, how easy was that?"
   - Ask: "What worked well?" and "What was confusing?"
   - Record ratings and comments
   - Move to next task

5. **After All Tasks**
   - Administer System Usability Scale (SUS) - 10 questions
   - Ask open-ended questions:
     - "What features would you use most?"
     - "What was most confusing?"
     - "Would you use this in your job?"
     - "What would make this more valuable?"

## Test Scenarios & Scripts

### Warm-Up Exercise (2 minutes)

**Facilitator Script:**

"Thank you for coming in! Before we start, I want to explain how this will work. We're testing the platform, not you—there are no right or wrong answers. Your job is to think out loud while you work. Tell me what you're thinking as you click around. Don't worry about being polite; if something confuses you, that's super helpful to know.

I'll give you a task scenario, and you'll try to complete it using the platform. You can move at your own pace. If you get stuck for more than a minute or two, I can help, but let me know if you want to keep trying first.

Let me show you what I mean. Here's a quick example: I want you to find tomorrow's weather. Can you do that using Google? Go ahead and show me how you'd do it." [Let them search, observe their thinking-aloud].

"Great! That's the kind of thing I'm looking for. Any questions before we start with the real tasks?"

---

### Task 1 Introduction Script

"Your first task is about finding specific information. Imagine you just started working in a county finance department in Colorado. The director asks you to find out when the county needs to formally adopt its annual budget—basically, when is the deadline? Use this platform to find that answer. Go ahead and take a look."

**Facilitation Tips:**
- Let them explore homepage first (often look at state selector)
- If stuck >2 min: "What are you trying to do right now?" 
- Don't suggest where to look
- Note if they search vs. browse
- Time from "go ahead" to finding the deadline date

---

### Task 2 Introduction Script

"This next task is about comparing. Let's say you manage compliance for a city, and you've got operations in both Colorado and Texas. Budget deadlines are different in each state, and you need to understand how they differ. The city council is meeting, and they want a simple one-page comparison of these two states' budget requirements—specifically budget adoption deadlines. Use the platform to find that information and create a version you could print or export for the board. Go ahead."

**Facilitation Tips:**
- They need to find a comparison feature (might not be obvious)
- Or they might do it manually (search each state)
- Note which approach they take
- Check if they can export result
- If stuck >2 min: "What's your goal again?" (remind them, don't help method)
- Time from start to having exportable result

---

### Task 3 Introduction Script

"For this one, imagine you're a compliance officer, and you want to make sure you don't miss any important changes in procurement requirements for your state. Set up this platform to notify you when something changes. You want to receive an email alert each week with any updates. Go ahead and get that set up."

**Facilitation Tips:**
- This should be relatively quick
- Most of the learning is about alert feature discoverability
- If stuck >1 min: "Where do you think you'd set this up?" 
- Note if they look for account settings, subscribe buttons, or search for "alert"
- Time from start to confirmation of subscription

---

### Task 4 Introduction Script

"Last one. Your city is facing a procurement audit, and you need to make sure your procurement process complies with state law. You need two things: (1) A practical guide explaining what you need to do—not just the legal text, but actual steps—and (2) A template or example document you could use. Use the platform to find these resources for your state. Go ahead."

**Facilitation Tips:**
- This tests discoverability of practical content vs. raw law
- Note how user distinguishes them
- Check if user can find templates
- Ask: "Is this a legal document or a guide?" to check understanding
- Time from start to having both resources found/downloaded

---

### Follow-Up Questions (Per Task)

**After Task 1:**
- "On a scale of 1-10, how easy was that to find?"
- "What helped you find it?" / "What made it harder?"
- "Would you remember how to do that again?"

**After Task 2:**
- "Did you notice a feature specifically for comparing?"
- "How clear was the comparison result?"
- "Would you be confident showing this to your board?"

**After Task 3:**
- "Do you set alerts for other tools (news, social media, etc.)?"
- "Would you actually use this alert feature?"
- "How confident are you that you set it up correctly?"

**After Task 4:**
- "How different is this guide from the legal text?"
- "Would you use this guide in your actual work?"
- "What else would make this guide more useful?"

---

### Debrief Questions (After All Tasks)

"Now that you've used the platform, I want to ask you a few bigger-picture questions:

1. **Overall Impression:** If you had to sum up your experience with this platform in one sentence, what would you say?

2. **Features:** What features did you find most valuable? What would you use most in your job?

3. **Biggest Confusion:** What was the most confusing part of using this?

4. **Missing Pieces:** Is there anything important that you felt was missing?

5. **Adoption:** If this tool was available at your organization, would you use it? How often?

6. **Recommendation:** Would you recommend this to other government administrators you know?

7. **One Change:** If you could ask us to change one thing, what would it be?

8. **People to Tell Us About:** Is there anyone else in your organization who should participate in testing this?"
