---

## Cross-Linking Strategy

### Type 1: Same State, Different Feature (Primary)
Each article links to 1-2 related articles in the same state. For example:
- CA-001 (Encumbrance) → CA-002 (GASB 54)
- CA-002 (GASB 54) → CA-001 (Encumbrance)

This helps users discover related compliance requirements within their state.

### Type 2: Same Feature, Different States (Secondary)
Each article links to the same feature in other Phase 1 states. For example:
- CA-001 (Encumbrance) → TX-001 (Encumbrance)
- TX-001 (Encumbrance) → CO-001 (Encumbrance)

This enables easy comparison and state-specific research.

### Type 3: Comparison Pages (Tertiary)
Each article references a comparison page covering the same feature across all three Phase 1 states. For example:
- CA-001 → `/comparisons/ca-tx-co-comparison-encumbrance-accounting`
- TX-001 → `/comparisons/ca-tx-co-comparison-encumbrance-accounting`
- CO-001 → `/comparisons/ca-tx-co-comparison-encumbrance-accounting`

These comparison pages should be created as Phase 2 work.

## SEO & Discovery Strategy

### Keyword Targeting
Each article targets long-tail keywords combining state + feature + compliance terms.

**Examples:**
- "california encumbrance accounting requirements"
- "texas gasb 54 fund accounting compliance"
- "colorado single audit support"
- "[state] [feature] local government compliance"

### Search Rankings Target
Phase 1 goal: Rank on Google page 1 for all 33 keyword phrases within 6 months.

**Expected Traffic:**
- Month 1-3: 100-200 organic visitors
- Month 6: 500-1,000 organic visitors
- Month 12: 2,000+ organic visitors

## Known Limitations & Future Work

### Current Limitations (Phase 1)
1. **Limited Depth**: Articles are 500-800 words (drafts/skeletons)
   - Phase 2 will expand to 1,500-2,000 words with implementation guides
   
2. **No Implementation Guides**: Articles describe requirements but not how-to steps
   - Phase 2 will add 5-10 step implementation guides
   
3. **Limited Examples**: Articles reference best practices but lack real-world examples
   - Phase 2 will include sample documents from actual jurisdictions
   
4. **No Comparison Pages**: Comparison URLs documented but pages not created yet
   - Phase 2 will create 11 comparison pages
   
5. **No Templates**: Articles mention templates but don't include them
   - Phase 2 will create downloadable templates (Word, Excel, PDF)
   
6. **No Interactive Checklists**: Articles reference checklists but don't have interactive versions
   - Phase 2 will create 11 interactive checklists

7. **No Video Content**: No video tutorials included
   - Phase 3 will include 10-15 video tutorials

### Assumptions Made
1. **Feature Names**: Used exact feature names from state-compliance-data.json
2. **State Requirements**: Content based on general compliance requirements; state-specific nuances may need SME validation
3. **Effective Dates**: Dates based on current law; may need annual updates
4. **Readability**: Hemingway Editor assumption; actual Grade 8 verification needed post-review
